## Installation

- download and unzip the element package
- create a [Child Theme](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/child-themes) in your YOOtheme Pro installation and activate the child theme
- copy the complete folders `hd-timeline` and `hd-timeline_item` into the directory `/templates/yootheme_child/builder/` (Joomla!) or `/wp-content/themes/yootheme-child/builder/` (WordPress) of your installation while *child* must be the name of your child theme
- access the YOOtheme Pro Page Builder, the custom elements should now be available

## Issues

Please report issues using the [Github issue tool](../../issues).

## Changes in Version 2.0.0-beta.10

To avoid a naming conflict, the former property `icon` got renamed to `timeline_icon`. When updating, *first* replace the timeline item files and *second* update YOOtheme Pro. This way, your existing timeline elements should be updated properly without having to re-assign the icons.

## To-do

- set icon ratio (per item)
- set text align per item
- set item alignment per item
- use breakpoints of style customizer (might require usage of LESS)
- allow masonry effect / overlap of items for alternate item alignment to reduce empty areas
- optimize CSS
